# Multitool

A simple multitool script packaged as a macOS app. Provides utilities like file organization, ASCII art generation, and system info.

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (if not already installed)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

After installation, add Homebrew to your PATH (the installer will print the exact command). Usually:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

---

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multitool.git
cd multitool
```

---

### 3. Install dependencies

Run the script once — it will check for required tools (`bc`, `figlet`, `top`, `df`, `uptime`) and prompt to install them if missing.

Or install manually:

```bash
brew install bc figlet
```

---

### 4. Unquarantine the app (if needed)

If you downloaded `Multitool.app` directly, macOS may block it. To remove the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Multitool.app
```

---

### 5. Run Multitool

- If you’re using the `.app` bundle: double‑click **Multitool.app** in Finder.  
- If you’re running the script directly:

```bash
chmod +x real_multitool.sh
./real_multitool.sh
```

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Homebrew not found

```
command not found: brew
```

Re‑install Homebrew:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then add it to your shell environment:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

---

### Permission denied when running the script

```
permission denied: ./real_multitool.sh
```

Fix with:

```bash
chmod +x real_multitool.sh
```

---

### macOS blocked the app

If you see “can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer”:

- Right‑click the app → **Open** → confirm.  
- Or run:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Multitool.app
```

---

### Dependencies still missing after install

If the script still says something like `Missing: figlet`:

- Make sure Homebrew’s bin directory is in your PATH:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

You should see `/opt/homebrew/bin` (Apple Silicon) or `/usr/local/bin` (Intel).

---

### Fonts not showing up in ASCII Art Generator

```bash
brew install figlet-fonts
```

Restart the script and fonts should appear.

---

### Still stuck?

Run from inside the repo folder:

```bash
cd multitool
./real_multitool.sh
```
